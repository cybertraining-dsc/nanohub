**Abstract**

The COVID-19 (COrona VIrus Disease 2019) pandemic has had profound global
consequences on health, economic, social, behavioral, and almost every major
aspect of human life. Therefore, it is of great importance to model COVID-19
and other pandemics in terms of the broader social contexts in which they take
place.  We present the architecture of an artificial intelligence enhanced
COVID-19 analysis (in short AICov) , which provides an integrative deep
learning framework for COVID-19 forecasting with population covariates, some of
which may serve as putative risk factors.  We have integrated multiple
different strategies into AICov, including the ability to use deep learning
strategies based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and event modeling.  To
demonstrate our approach, we have introduced a framework that integrates
population covariates from multiple sources. Thus, AICov not only includes data
on COVID-19 cases and deaths but, more importantly, the population's
socioeconomic, health, and behavioral risk factors at their specific locations.
The compiled data are fed into AICov, and thus we obtain improved prediction by
the integration of the data to our model as compared to one that only uses case
and death data. As we use deep learning our models adapt over time while
learning the model from past data.
